# Project Name: Contacts Application
## Project Description
This application serves to function as a "digital rolodex", where users can utilize CRUD operations to alter information that saves to a SQLite database. User interaction involves a series of menus driven by character input. 
## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Include at least 3 contact types**
- Implements Personal and Business contacts, where Personal includes Family or Other.
- Business contacts can be notated as "Work-Related".
- **Task 2: Ability to add and remove contacts**
- Handled within main menu.
- Includes fillable fields to add a contact, for database table information.
- **Task 3: Ability to display contact information**
- Can display all contacts.
- Can display contacts searched by last initial.
- **Ability to update a contact**
- Can update specific portions of a contact through submenu selection.
- **Task 5: Inheritance implementation**
- 
- **Task 6: Composition implementation**
- 
- **Task 7: Polymorphism implementation**
- 
- **Task 8: Interface creation**
- User interface is implemented via CLI.
- **Task 9: Constructor implementation**
- 
- **Task 10: Access specifier utilization**
- 
- **Task 11: Abstract class implementation**
- 
- **Task 12: Database implementation**
- Database implementation achieved using SQLite database.
- "contacts.db" file included to showcase database functionality.
## Project Skills Learned
- Inheritance and composition concepts implemented within phase 1.
- Polymorphism and interface creation implemented within phase 2.
- Constructors, access specifiers, and abstract classes included within phase 3.
- Utilization of SQLite database to apply database implementation.
- Utilization of VSCode to achieve all project goals and structure.
- Familiarization with GitHub to implement tagging and versions, as well as proper commits.
## Language Used
- **Java**: For front and backend development, as well as OOP principles.
- **SQL**: For database implementation using a SQLite database.
## Development Process Used
- **Agile Methodology**: Emphasizing iterative development, continuous
feedback, and collaboration.
## Notes
- Application can be launched via the main file: "App.java".
- Interaction with the application requires CLI.
